# Mixins? Coremods? ATs? What are those?

## [Mixins](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin)

Mixins are a type of Coremod that use Injection in order to coremod the game using only necessary code instead of a full coremod.

Mixins were written by our good friend Mumfrey.

They essentially inject other people's code into the game code. This is mostly commonly done to override game logic in order to help their mod along.

Most Mixins could be integrated into Forge proper, but people don't do it.

## [CoreMods](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/CoreMods)

CoreMods are able to transform the game more heavily than Mixins.

Without getting into the technical detail, They can essentially write new code into Minecraft's vanilla classes without needing to worry about dealing with Mixins.

These are the worst type of vanilla modifying code, since they can overwrite large portions of the game and make it difficulty to debug crashes and bugs.

## [Access Transformers (ATs)](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/accesstransformers/)

Access Transformers, or ATs are the most friendly type of coremod.

An Access Transformer simply modifies the [access modifiers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html) in Java. For example, a `public` method can be called by any package or class, but a `protected` method can only be called by a subclass, or a class in the same package.

An Access Transformer simply changes this access modifier to allow it to be more friendly without having to use slow and nasty [reflection](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javareflection.html).
